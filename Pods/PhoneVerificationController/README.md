## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.


## Requirements


## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate PhoneVerificationController into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

pod 'FireBase/Auth'
pod 'PhoneVerificationController'
```

Note that you'll need to add `FireBase/Auth` as well (we can't depend on it as it's a static framework). Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Usage

Follow the first 2 steps for Firebase authentication on iOS as documenteded [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/phone-auth). PhoneVerificationController will handle the rest, as long as you invoke it using:

```swift
import FirebaseAuth
import PhoneVerificationController

let configuration = Configuration(requestCode: { phone, completion in
	PhoneAuthProvider.provider().verifyPhoneNumber(phone, completion: completion)
}, signIn: { verificationID, verificationCode, completion in
	let credential = PhoneAuthProvider.provider().credential(withVerificationID: verificationID, verificationCode: verificationCode)
	Auth.auth().signIn(with: credential) { _, error in completion(error) }
})
let vc = PhoneVerificationController(configuration: configuration)
vc.delegate = self
present(vc, animated: true)
```

You'll receive a callback if the verification succeeds, or is cancelled.
